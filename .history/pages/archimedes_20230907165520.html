    <h1>Archimedes: The Ancient Mathematician</h1>
    
    <p>Archimedes of Syracuse, born around 287 BCE in the city of Syracuse, Sicily, was one of the most brilliant mathematicians, physicists, and engineers of antiquity. He is often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

    <p>Archimedes came from an educated and well-respected family. He received his early education in Alexandria, Egypt, which was a center of learning in the ancient world. There, he studied under the guidance of renowned scholars.</p>

    <h2>Contributions to Mathematics</h2>

    <p>Archimedes made groundbreaking contributions to various branches of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, and calculus. He is known for his development of the method of exhaustion, a precursor to integral calculus, which he used to calculate areas and volumes of irregular shapes.</p>

    <h2>Pi and Circles</h2>

    <p>One of Archimedes' most famous achievements was his accurate approximation of the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi). He calculated the value of pi by inscribing and circumscribing polygons around a circle, demonstrating that pi is greater than 3 and less than 4.</p>
