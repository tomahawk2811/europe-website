        Remembering Archimedes of Ancient Greece
    </header>
    <hr>
    <p>Archimedes of Syracuse was born in the year 287 BC. Archimedes was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from (ancient) Syracuse in Ancient Greece. He is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity, having made significant contributions to various fields of mathematics and mechanics.</p>
    <img src="/images/GettyImages-56217082-73a561f-1.webp" alt="Archimedes portrait">
    <p>Known for laying the groundwork for modern calculus, Archimedes is also celebrated for his work on the geometry of spheres, cylinders, and the concept of buoyancy. His inventions, including the Archimedean screw and war machines, have left an enduring legacy on both science and engineering.</p>
    <p>Archimedes lived during a tumultuous time for Syracuse. In 212 BCE, during the Roman siege of the city, Archimedes continued his scientific work amidst the chaos. According to historical accounts, he was killed by a Roman soldier while engrossed in solving a mathematical problem, despite orders to spare him.</p>
    <p>Archimedes' work has had a profound and lasting impact on science and mathematics. His principles are still taught in schools and universities, and his inventive spirit continues to inspire engineers and scientists. Archimedes is celebrated as one of the greatest mathematicians and inventors of antiquity, and his contributions remain pivotal in the history of science.</p>
    <h2>Key Contributions and Legacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong></strong> Developed the principles of lever and buoyancy, and laid the foundation for modern calculus.</li>
        <li><strong></strong> Made significant contributions to the understanding of the geometry of spheres and cylinders.</li>
        <li><strong></strong> Invented the Archimedean screw, which is still used for lifting water, and various war machines.</li>
        <li><strong></strong> During the Siege of Syracuse, Archimedes designed several innovative war machines, including the Claw of Archimedes and the Heat Ray. The Claw was designed to lift and capsize enemy ships, while the Heat Ray purportedly used concentrated sunlight to set enemy ships on fire, although its historical accuracy is debated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Surviving Works of Archimedes</h1>
    <p>Measurement of a Circle:

        This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of Conon of Samos. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an approximation of the value of pi (π), showing that it is greater than ⁠
        223
        /
        71
        ⁠ (3.1408...) and less than ⁠
        22
        /
        7
        ⁠ (3.1428...).
        
        <p>The Sand Reckoner:
            In this treatise, also known as Psammites, Archimedes finds a number that is greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. This book mentions the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8×1063 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.</p>
        
        <p>On the Equilibrium of Planes:
            There are two books to On the Equilibrium of Planes: the first contains seven postulates and fifteen propositions, while the second book contains ten propositions. In the first book, Archimedes proves the law of the lever, which states that: Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.</p>
    
        <p>Archimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures including triangles, parallelograms and parabolas.</p>
        
        Quadrature of the Parabola:
        In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He achieves this in one of his proofs by calculating the value of a geometric series that sums to infinity with the ratio 1/4.</p>
